        <p>An average commuter in the US loses 42 hours per year just waiting in traffic as shown by a study[1], which adds up to wastage of 10 months in one’s duration of a career. That’s a lot of man-hours being wasted in doing nothing productive. If a similar study was done for Indian drivers, it would most likely project a digit equivalent to or greater than that of US drivers.
            If you haven’t been living under a rock, you would have heard about Self Driving cars, cars that can drive around by themselves. An idea that sounds like it has been borrowed from Science Fiction but kid you not, Self Driving cars are right around the corner. Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. has actually built one and launched their service which they call Waymo One, under which they are offering paid rides to a subset of people enrolled for early rider programs around the city of Phoenix in Arizona.            
        </p>
        <p>For the early rider members, it's easy to hail a ride from the huge fleet of autonomous cars owned by Waymo, due to the process of requesting ride not being much different from traditional experience offered by companies like Uber and Lyft.The rider first needs to open the Waymo app, confirm pickup location, enter drop location, confirm the safest place to board the car and then with a press of a button the ride would be on its way. The passenger is greeted with a Chrysler Pacifica minivan which can accommodate up to three adults and a child. Customers enrolled in early rider program are also allowed to bring along their friends or family members who weren’t a part of the early ridership program.

            Waymo One is a huge stride towards achieving full autonomy in a vehicle. Autonomy is categorized into six levels starting from level 0 to level 5 as shown in the image.
        Waymo One cars are level 4 autonomous vehicles and hence most of the operations are performed by the vehicle itself without driver intervention though there’s a human operator seated in the driver seat to take over the control if anything goes out of order.If that wasn’t assuring enough, Waymo claims their cars are the most experienced drivers on road, having driven more than 10 million miles[2], further adding 1 million miles every month. To put into perspective, its major competitor, Uber took second place at 3 million miles but was forced to shut down all of its ongoing operations in a later incident involving the death of a pedestrian. The incident took place in Tempe, Arizona, a city where Waymo has already proved their dominance.

            The wave of autonomous vehicle truly began with the Stanford Cart, which was first built in 1961. It could find its way around objects with the aid of basic cameras and needed 10 to 15 minutes to plan every one-meter move. The field didn’t see much involvement until 2005 DARPA(Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) Grand Challenge, in which a team led by Sebastian Thurn, then director of Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory completed the competition of building a car which drove 132-miles of rough terrain near the California/Nevada state line. The same project also birthed the Google Car project.

            It all started out as Google Car project in 2009, led by Google co-founder and now Alphabet Inc. President Sergey Brin. The initiative progressed quickly and within 18 months accompanied with the help of Darpa challenge veterans, the company was able to build a system that could drive around some of California’s toughest roads. The first self-driving car to come out of the Google Car Project was a Toyota Prius, modified to hold the technology like LiDAR, Radar and multiple cameras, required to control the car and navigate it around. In 2014, Google introduced a pod mobile they called Firefly which soon became the symbol of Google Car. It didn’t have any steering wheel, gas or brake pedal and wasn’t designed for mass production and was only intended for study and experimentation - for learning where to position the sensors, what controls to give to the passenger. In 2016, the Google Car project was named Waymo and started testing its cars on public roads. 
        </p>
        In conclusion, 2018 has been a good year for Waymo, it’s leading the autonomous vehicle market. Even the big fishes of the pond such as Tesla and Ford are light years behind Waymo in terms of miles on their odometers. The company was recently valued by Morgan Stanley at a staggering $175 billion[3]. To add a cherry on top, it was permitted to operate on California roads by the DMV, which allows Waymo to test its vehicles Day and Night on California roads in all weathers, with posted speed limits up to 65 mph. The company’s future challenge is figuring out how to become profitable, but that does seem like an immediate concern for a company backed by a multi-billion tech giant like Alphabet Inc.
