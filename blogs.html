          <h1>WAYMO, GOOGLE’S BET IN SELF-DRIVING REVOLUTION</h1>
          <small>17 January, 2019</small>
          <p>
            An average commuter in the US loses 42 hours per year just waiting in traffic as shown by a study[1], which adds up to wastage of 10 months in one’s
             duration of a career. That’s a lot of man-hours being wasted in doing nothing productive. If a similar study was done for Indian drivers, it would most
              likely project a digit equivalent to or greater than that of US drivers.

          <h1>Cognitive Biases: What They Are and How They Affect People</h1>
          <small>October, 2021</small>
          <p>
            One example of a well-known cognitive bias is the halo effect, which is a cognitive bias that causes our impression of someone or something in one domain to influence our impression of them in other domains. The halo effect means, for example, that when we think someone is physically attractive, we tend to believe that they are also more knowledgeable and have a better personality compared to what we would think if they were unattractive.
