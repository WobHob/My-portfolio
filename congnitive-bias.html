        <p>One example of a well-known cognitive bias is the halo effect, which is a cognitive bias that causes our impression of someone or something in one domain to influence our impression of them in other domains. The halo effect means, for example, that when we think someone is physically attractive, we tend to believe that they are also more knowledgeable and have a better personality compared to what we would think if they were unattractive.            
        </p>
        <p>Another example of a cognitive bias is the illusion of control, which is a cognitive bias that causes us to overestimate our ability to control the outcome of situations where chance plays a greater role than skill. The illusion of control means, for example, that we might overestimate our ability to succeed in a risky business venture, even if that venture is likely to fail regardless of how much effort we put into it.
        </p>

            Another example of a cognitive bias is the outgroup homogeneity bias, which causes people to perceive members of outside groups as being more similar to one another than members of groups that they are a part of. This happens primarily because people tend to allocate more of their attention to members of their own group, since interactions with those people are often perceived as more important.

            In addition, other examples of cognitive biases include the following:
        <ul>
            <li>The rhyme-as-reason effect. The rhyme-as-reason effect is a cognitive bias that makes people more likely to remember, repeat, and believe statements that contain a rhyme, compared to those that do not. For example, people generally perceive the aphorism “woes unite foes” as more accurate than the aphorisms “woes unite enemies” or “misfortunes unite foes”, despite the fact that they all mean roughly the same thing.
            </li>
            <li>The zero-sum bias. The zero-sum bias is a cognitive bias that causes people to mistakenly view certain situations as being zero-sum, meaning that they incorrectly believe that one party’s gains are directly balanced by other parties’ losses. For example, the zero-sum bias can cause people to think that there is competition for a resource that they feel is limited, in situations where the resource in question is actually unlimited and freely available.</li>    
            <li>The fundamental attribution error. The fundamental attribution error is a cognitive bias that causes people to underestimate the influence of environment-based situational factors on people’s behavior, and to overestimate the influence of personality-based dispositional factors. For example, the fundamental attribution error can cause someone to assume that if some stranger looks angry, then they must be an angry person in general, even though this person might have been driven to temporary anger by something, such as someone else being rude to them.</li>
